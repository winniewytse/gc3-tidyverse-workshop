library(tidyverse)
bacs <- read.csv("https://osf.io/6gsy8/download")
```

Data wrangling tasks: 

1. Recode `Ethnic`: 1 = "White", 2 = "Other", 4 = "Asian", 6 = "African/African-American"
2. Exclude the observation(s) for "Other"
3. Include the observations for Age < 25
4. Calculate the sum score of CPS and EES scales for each individual
5. Calculate the mean of the CPS sum scores for each ethnic group and report them in a statement (keep your report reproducible)
6. Make scatterplots of CSP sum scores against EES sum scores, separated by ethnic groups (presenting any aesthetics by groups or facetting works)

Alternatively, work on any relevant tasks for your own dataset. We are here to help if you have any questions :)
